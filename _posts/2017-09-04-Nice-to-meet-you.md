After years of deliberation I have finally begun work on a portfolio site. I have scoured the internet looking for a content manager
that would allow me to make the perfect site and was (sadly) unable to find one that would give me the level of control I so desperately
wanted... until one day... I realized "I know how to build a website! How hard could it be??". So here I am, trying to create this from scratch
and hoping that I don't f**k this up.

Stay tuned!
